# Toolbox
Toolbox is an Android application that contains common tools (like a calculator, timer, notepad, etc.) on one application.  
Toolbox uses a `BottomNavigationView` for navigating through tools.  
The app will remind you when the any update is released.  
Toolbox is an *indie project* that has **no ads** and **does not collect user data**.  
What I want from users is only to suggest me improvements and telling me about the issues the app may has.  
If you see any bugs, you can send me an email (navigate to app settings) or add an issue in this GitHub repository.
